## TinkerCAD

All projects are designed and simulated using [TinkerCAD](https://www.tinkercad.com/). TinkerCAD is a free, easy-to-use web app for 3D design, electronics, and coding.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/CircuitStuff.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd CircuitStuff`
3. Open the C++ code files in your preferred IDE.
4. View the project images to see the circuit design.
5. Use TinkerCAD to recreate or simulate the projects.

Feel free to explore and contribute to this repository. Happy tinkering!
